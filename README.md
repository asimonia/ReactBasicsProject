## Why React?
Library for building UI.
Two huge benefits: its DECLARITIVE and COMPONENT-BASED
React provides us tools to build one component and use it as many times
Component: A self-contained, reusable piece of our interface
Declarative: A programming model where we describe the result we want to achieve
Problem is that the bookkeeping needed to manual manipulate the DOM UI and keep it in sync with the javascript Data Model can grow out of hand.
Build a Virtual DOM for our UI.

## State and the Virtual DOM
Describe everything in the jsx files.  This is called the Virtual DOM.

DOM: (Document Object Model) The interface for managing the elements in an HTML page.
Virtual DOM: A pure JavaScript representation of a DOM tree.
